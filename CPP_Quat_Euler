# Quat::Euler #

## Syntax ##
- Vec3 Euler()

## Returns ##
Returns a Euler rotation representing this rotation.

## Remarks ##
Although Eulers are more intuitive, quaternions are a more accurate way of describing rotations. Conversion of quaternions to Euler rotations maybe involve a loss of data in some situations.
