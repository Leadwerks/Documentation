# Stream::Close #
This method manually closes the stream for further read and write operations.

## Syntax ##
- void **Close**()

## Remarks ##
It is not necessary to call this method, as a stream will automatically close when it is deleted, but this method provides an additional mechanism to explicitly close it.
