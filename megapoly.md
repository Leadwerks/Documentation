# MegaPoly

Ultra Engine's MegaPoly technology is a set of techniques that dynamically upsample low-detail meshes to make resolution-independent 3D models suitable for VR, while eliminating excess polygons and other problems conventional tessellation techniques usually suffer from.

The following features are supported:

- Resolution-independent curved surfaces
- Dynamic view-based level of detail
- Geometric surface detail without cracks or holes
