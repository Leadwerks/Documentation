# MegaPoly

Ultra Engine's MegaPoly technology is a set of techniques and tools that can be used to dynamically upsample low-detail meshes to make resolution-independent 3D models suitable for VR. MegaPoly prevents excessive subdivision and other problems conventional tessellation techniques usually suffer from.

The following features are supported:

- Resolution-independent curved surfaces
- Dynamic view-based level of detail for organic or mechanical shapes
- Geometric surface detail without cracks or holes

MegaPoly works with most of your existing 3D models, with minimal adjustment. Typically, MegaPoly models will produce 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer triangles than conventional tessellation.

This feature is still in development and should be considered experimental.
