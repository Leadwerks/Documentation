# Vertex Panel

The vertex panel provides fine control over vertex displacement settings. By default, vertices will use the auto setting, but you can override this for more precise control if you wish.

When auto displacement is enabled, a vertex that is connected to more than one unhidden faces will have displacement disabled, to prevent cracks from forming along the edges of primitives.
