# Entity::GetQuaternion #
This method retrieves the entity rotation as a quaternion. Quaternions are more accurate than Euler angles because they do not suffer from Gimbal lock, but they are more difficult to intuitively understand.

## Syntax ##
- [Quat](CPP_Quat.md) **GetQuaternion**()

## Returns ##
