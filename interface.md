# Editor Interface

When you start the Ultra Engine editor, the interface will look like this:

The main window displays a toolbar across the top, four viewports for viewing the map, and a side panel containing additional controls.

The toolbar contains button to open, reset, or save the map, buttons to select the current mouse tool, and buttons to show or hide the side panel and console.

The console displays the program log, warnings, and errors. Lua commands can be entered into the text field at the bottom and executed.

The side panel contains tabs for the object panel, asset browser, and map browser.

The object panel displays object templates you can select to create a new object.

The asset browser shows your game's directory and files.

The map browser shows all the objects in the current scene, as well as allowing you to view and edit properties.

When the brush face tool is selected, the face panel shows the texture mapping properties of any selected faces.

When the terrain tool is selected, the terrain panel shows the selected terrain's material layers, as well as tools to modify the terrain.
