The first time you run Leadwerks, the [project manager](projectmanager.md) will appear. If this is your first time running the program ever, there will be no projects listed in the window.

Press the **Create** button to create a new project. On the next screen you can enter the project name, change the location on your computer, and select the programming language and type of project you want to create.

Press the **Next** button and wait a moment for the new project to be created.

You can now click on the new project in the list, and the editor will open the project.

The View Panel takes up mpst of the main window and contains four viewports, which allow visualizing and interacting with your 3D scene. By default, the View Panel is divided into four viewports showing three orthographic views and a 3D perspective view.

You can customize the View Panel to show three, two, or just a single viewport, depending on your preference.

Each viewport can be configured to display a 3D perspective view or any of the available orthographic views.

## Navigating Viewports

- **Panning**: To move the camera within a viewport, press and hold the **middle mouse button** while dragging the mouse. This action allows you to pan the camera and explore your 3D scene from different angles.

- **Free-Look Mode**: In any 3D perspective viewport, you can enter a free-look mode by pressing and holding the **right mouse button**. This mode enables you to look around by moving the mouse and navigate using the **WASD keys** for forward, left, backward, and right movements. Holding the **E and Q** keys will move the camera up and down. You can also use the **mouse wheel** for zooming in orthographic viewports or controlling the camera's forward/backwards movement in 3D perspective viewports. You can press and hold the **Shift key** to accelerate these movements.

- **Grid Size Adjustment**: You can easily adjust the grid size for precise object placement by pressing the **[ and ] keys**.
