# 3D Space

To convert our 2D grid into a 3D grid, we just need to add one additional axis called Z. Since we can't actually draw a 3D shape on a 2D image, we will draw the Z axis with some perspective, at a 45 degree angle. All coordinates on the 3D grid now have three components: X, Y, and Z.

I've also labeled and color-coded the positive and negative directions for each axis. Picture the postive Z axis going into the screen, and the negative Z axis coming out of the screen.
