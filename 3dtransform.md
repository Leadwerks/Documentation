# 3D Space Transformations

One of the most powerful techniques in 3D games is the ability to transform points, vectors, and other data from one entity's space to another.

You can think of space transformations as data relative to another entity. For example, if an entity is positioned at (10,0,0), and its not rotated, what would the position (11,0,0) be relative to that entity? The answer is (1,0,0).

If the entity was positioned at (10,0,0) and its rotation was (0,180,0), the position (11,0,0) relative to the entity would be (-1,0,0), since the entity is spun around 180 degrees.
