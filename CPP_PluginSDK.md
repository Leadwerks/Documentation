# Plugin SDK #
The Ultra Engine plugin SDK allows modular functionality to be added to the engine.

## Overview ##
A plugin can be loaded by any Leadwerks 5 program using the [LoadPlugin](LoadPlugin.md) command. Plugins must be compiled separately for each supported platform.
Windows uses DLL files for plugins. MacOS uses DYLIB files. Linux uses SO files. You can use an asterisk for the file extension in the LoadPlugin command, and the engine will choose a file extension based on the current platform:

```c++
LoadPlugin("Plugins/Basis.*");
```

A plugin is only required to have one function called "GetPluginInfo". This will return a string in JSON format containing information about the plugin. A top-level plugin object must be specified. This object is required to have string elements for "title" and "description". You can optionally include some text about the author:

```json
{
  "plugin":
  {
    "title": "Plugin Title",
    "description": "Description of the plugin and its functionality.",
    "author": "Copyright John Smith 2021."
  }
}
```

## Properties ##
Other miscellaneous properties can be added to tell the engine how to handle the plugin.

| Property | Type | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| collapseSavedModels | boolean | if set to true models will be collapsed before SaveModel is called |
| redistributable | boolean | indicates whether the plugin can be redistributed in a game or application, defaults to true |
| saveModelExtensions | string or array | file format extensions supported for model saving |
| saveModelFilter | string | file type filter for save file dialogs |
| saveTextureExtensions | string or array | file format extensions supported for texture saving |
| saveTextureFilter | string | file type filter for save file dialogs |

## Functions ##

The plugin's functionality is defined by the functions it contains. A plugin can contain any of the following functions. It is possible to combine functionality, like a plugin that
can save model files and load a new texture format. However, it is best to limit plugins to a single purpose, or a single file format, like loading and saving of a new image format.

| Function | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| [GetPluginInfo](PluginSDK_GetPluginInfo.md) | Required function that returns information about the plugin. |
| [ConvertPixmap]() | Converts pixel data between formats. |
| [LoadTexture]() | Loads an image from memory in a specific format. |
| [SaveTexture]() | Saves an image to memory in a specific format. |
| [Cleanup]() | Called after load and save commands to free allocated resources. |

A package plugin must contain all of the following commands:

| Function | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| LoadPackage | Loads a model from memory in a specific format. |
| CountPackageFiles | Loads a model from memory in a specific format. |
| GetPackageFileSize | Loads a model from memory in a specific format. |
| LoadPackageFile | Loads a model from memory in a specific format. |
| FreePackage | Loads a model from memory in a specific format. |
| GetPackageFileName | Loads a model from memory in a specific format. |
