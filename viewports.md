# Viewports

The view panel occupies most of the middle of the main window and displays the program viewports. Viewports function as the windows through which we can view the 3D scene. By default the view panel is divided into four viewports showing orthgraphic views of the top, bottom, and side of the scene, with an additional viewport showing a 3D perspective view. The view panel can also be set to display three, two, or one single viewport.

Each viewport can be changed to show a 3D perspective view or any orthographic view (top, bottom, left, right, front, or back).

To pan the viewport camera press and hold the middle mouse button on a viewport and drag the mouse.

For free-look mode in any 3D perspective viewport, press and hold the right mouse button. Move the mouse to look around, and use the WASD keys to move forward, left, backwards, and right. You can use the mouse wheel to zoom in orthographic viewports or move forward and back in 3D perspective viewports.

You can adjust the grid size by pressing the "[" and "]" keys
