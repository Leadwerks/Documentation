# Creating Primitives

Primitives are simple geometry shapes that can be used as building blocks for your game levels. Four basic shapes are available:
- Box
- Wedge
- Cylinder
- Cone

These simple shapes can be modified and combined to form just about any architectural geometry you can imagine.

You may sometimes see these types of objects referred to as "brushes", for historical reasons.

## Creating Primitives

To create a primitive, press the **object creation button** in the toolbar to active creation mode. By default, the box primitive will be selected when you start the program. You can click again on the button to open the **object panel** and view other objects that are available to create.

In any of the viewports, click and hold the **left mouse button**. Drag the mouse with the button pressed to begin drawing the outline of the new object. You can further adjust the boundaries by resizing the edges or moving the shape. Press the **Enter** key to create the new object, or press the **right mouse button** and select the **Create** popup menu.

Some primitives will show a window with additional parameters that can be adjusted before the object is created.
