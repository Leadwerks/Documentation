# Proximity Testing

Proximity testing is an important technique that allows us to detect nearby objects, and their relative position to an entity of interest. This is usually accomplished by a rough test performed with the [World:GetEntitiesInArea](World_GetEntitiesInArea.md) command. Entities returned by this command can be further discarded based on a variety of finer tests.
