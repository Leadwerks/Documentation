# Vegetation

The vegetation tool lets you paint trees, plants, rocks, and other items onto a landscape to quickly create entire forests.

Like terrain materials, vegetation is separated into separate layers, each with its own properties. Each layer can contain one or more variations. These are usually different versions of a model that help to create a more random look to the scene and prevent repetition. The variations are randomly selected by the vegetation system.

Each vegetation layer variation has its own properties that can be adjusted.

## Adding Vegetation Layers

To add a new vegation layer to the terrain, press the **Add** button at the bottom of the vegetation panel. Select the **Add Layer** popup menu. An file open dialog will appear, allowing you to browse to and select a model file to use for the vegetation layer. If you select multiple model files with the file open dialog, each model will be added as a variation in the new layer.
