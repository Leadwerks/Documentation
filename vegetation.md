# Vegetation

The vegetation tool lets you paint trees, plants, rocks, and other items onto a landscape to quickly create entire forests.

Like terrain materials, vegetation is separated into separate layers, each with its own properties. Each layer can contain one or more variations. These are usually different versions of a model that help to create a more random look to the scene and prevent repetition. The variations are randomly selected by the vegetation system.

Each vegetation layer variation has its own properties that can be adjusted.

**Model**: Selects the model to use for the variation.

**Alignment**: You can choose center (the default) mode, per-vertex, or rotate to normal.
