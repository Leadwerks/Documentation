### Standalone

The following installation instructions only apply if you own a license for the standalone version of Ultra Engine.

First, download and install the [Ultra Engine Client](https://github.com/UltraEngine/ultraengine.github.io/raw/main/UltraClient.exe). This application will allow you to install different versions of the game engine and receive updates. When you open the application you will be prompted to sign into your Ultra Engine account. If you do not have an account yet, you can create one [here](https://www.ultraengine.com/community/register).

The **Updates** tab allows you to select and install a version of the engine.

The **Community** tab contains links to community features you can access on our site.

The **Learn** tab contains links to documentation.

The **Billing** tab contains information about your account and license.

The **Settings** tab contains various settings for the client application.

When your license is active, you can select a channel in the **Updates** panel and install the engine. If you do not have an active license you can get one [here](https://www.ultraengine.com/community/store/category/1-software/).

The default channel will contain the current stable build, which does not change. You can select a newer version and receive more frequent updates, but the releases will not be as thoroughly tested. If you want to switch channels, uninstall the engine and select a new channel to install.

Once the game engine is installed you can press the launch button to run the [editor](editor.md) and begin building games.
