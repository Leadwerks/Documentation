# Ultra Engine Documentation

Welcome to the Ultra Engine documentation. Here you will learn how to use the software to build high-performance games and applications.

## System Requirements

- Discrete GPU with support for Vulkan 1.3 (Integrated graphics are not supported yet)
- Windows 10 or 11
- [Visual Studio Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) (You probably already have this installed)
- The latest graphics drivers are recommended

You can try running the [Ultra Engine benchmarks](https://github.com/UltraEngine/Benchmarks) to make sure your computer is compatible.

## Installation

First, download and run the [Ultra Engine Client](https://www.ultraengine.com/files/UltraEngineClient.exe). This application will allow you to install different versions of the software and receive updates. When you open the application you will be prompted to sign into your Ultra Engine account. If you do not have an account yet, you can create one [here](https://www.ultraengine.com/community/register).
