# Mouse Tools

The left-side bar contains buttons for various mouse tools you can use to edit objects in your scene.

## Selection Tool

The selection tool only selects objects, and does not perform any editing. You can select objects by clicking the **left mouse button** with the mouse cursor positioned over them in the 3D view, or positioned over an edge in one of the orthographic views.

You can select multiple objects, or deselect one object at a time, by holding the **Control key** when clicking to select.

You can draw a selection area by clicking and holding the **left mouse button** and dragging the mouse. A transparent rectangle will appear. When you release the mouse, all objects that intersect the bounds you drew will be selected.

## Face Tool

The face mouse tool allows you to move primitive faces to change the geometry of objects.

In the 3D viewport, you can move faces along the X and Z axes. If you hold the **Alt key** you can move faces along the Y axis.

When the vertex tool is in use, additional properties are available in the [face panel](facepanel).

## Vertex Tool

The vertex mouse tool allows you to move primitive vertices to change the geometry of objects.

In the 3D viewport, you can move vertices along the X and Z axes. If you hold the **Alt key** you can move vertices along the Y axis.

When the vertex tool is in use, additional properties are available in the [vertex panel](vertexpanel).
