# Publish Dialog

The publish dialog allows you to pacjage your game for distribution. Select the **File > Publish** menu item to open this dialog.

You can select the output folder and specify file types to include in the exported package. When you press the **Publish** button the project folder will be scanned for files the game uses, and all required files will be packaged into an encrypted ZIP file. The game's release executable and any required DLLs will also be copied into the output folder.
