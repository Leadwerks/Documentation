The interface is divided into the following areas:

## Toolbar

The toolbar contains buttons for frequently performed actions.

## Code Area

Most of the interface is dedicated to a tabbed panel that can display multiple code files.

## Side Panel

The right-side panel provides an area for Lua debugging information, when the debugger is being used.

## Bottom Panel

The bottom panel provides a tabbed interface showing the printed output when the game is run, as well as a list of any errors that occur while running the game.
