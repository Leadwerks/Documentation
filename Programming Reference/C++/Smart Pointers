# Smart Pointers
The engine API makes extensive use of C++ shared pointers. This drastically simplifies our code, allows a more robust multithreaded design, and prevents common programming errors. Shared pointers use reference counting instead of full garbage collection. They are fast, thread-safe, and almost as thorough as full garbage colleciton, with virtually no performance cost.
