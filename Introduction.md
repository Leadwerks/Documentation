# Welcome to Leadwerks 5
Welcome to the **Leadwerks 5 SDK** documentation. You're about to learn how to use the fastest 3D engine in the world to create high-performance simulations and games.

Leadwerks 5 SDK supports three programming languages. C++ offers the fastest code execution speed, best compatibility with third-party libraries, and is suitable for advanced projects. C# offers fast compilation times, easier syntax, and is fast enough for most projects. Lua is lightweight, easy to learn, and is suitable for simple projects. Additionally, Lua scripts can be combined with programs written in C++ and C#.

## Getting Started ##

You currently have selected the C++ language documentation. You can change this by clicking on the language links in the header at the top of this page.

To start programming with you need to install the free [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) from Microsoft.
