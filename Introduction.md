# Welcome to Engine
Welcome to the Engine SDK documentation. You're about to start learning how to use the most advanced 3D engine in the world to create high-performance simulations and games.

Engine SDK can be programmed with three languages. **C++** offers the fastest code execution speed, best compatibility with third-party libraries, and is suitable for advanced projects. **C#** offers fast compilation times, simpler syntax, and is fast enough for most projects. **Lua** is lightweight, easy to learn, and is suitable for simple projects.

## System Requirements ##
- Discrete GPU with support for Vulkan 1.1
- 64-bit operating system
- Quad-core CPU @2.0 GHz
- 4.0 Gb RAM
- 200 Mb free hard drive space

## Getting Started ##

You currently have selected the C++ language documentation. You can change this by clicking on the language links in the header at the top of this page.

To start programming with C++ you need to install the free [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) from Microsoft.
