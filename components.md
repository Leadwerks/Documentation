You can download two sample scenes for this tutorial [here](https://www.leadwerks.com/community/files/file/3592-components-sample/) or use the [downloads manager](downloadsmanager.md) to install the package into a new project.

## Entity Component System

The Leadwerks entity component system (ECS) allows you to attach code files to objects in the scene to give them behavior in the game. Open the scene "component.map" from the sample package. You'll find two blue boxes, one with the SwingingDoor component, and the other with the SlidingDoor component. There is also a pivot in the middle of the scene with the FPSPlayer component added to it.

If you select the **Game > Run** menu item to run the game, you can use the WASD keys to move around, and open either door by walking up to it and pressing the E key.
