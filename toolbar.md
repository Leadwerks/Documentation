## File Operations

On the left side of the Toolbar, you'll find standard file operations, including:

- **New**: Create a new project or scene.
- **Open**: Load an existing map into the editor.
- **Save**: Save your current project or scene, ensuring that your progress is preserved.
- **Undo and Redo**: These buttons allow you to reverse or redo recent actions, helping you navigate through your editing history.

## Edit Operations

The next group contains buttons for common editing operations.

- **Cut**: Removes and copies the selected objects.
- **Copy**: Copies the selected objects, but leaves them intact.
- **Paste**: Creates a new instance of any previously copied objects.
- **Delete**: Removes the selected objects from the scene.

## Undo Operations

The next group contains buttons to undo and redo the last editing step. These buttons will be disabled if the current state of the program does not allow the operation, for example, if it is a new scene and nothing has been created yet.

## Zoom Operations

The next group contains buttons to zoom in and out in the current viewport.

## Object Button

The object button is a special control used to activate the object creation tool and select an object to make.

When you click the arrow on the left side of the button, or just click the button when it is already in the selected state, a panel will appear below showing all the objects you can create.

## Side Panel and Console

The buttons on the right-hand side of the Toolbar provide the ability to toggle the visibility of the Side Panel and Console. These panels are valuable resources that allow you to access additional controls and information as needed. You can show or hide them to streamline your workspace and focus on your primary tasks.

The Toolbar is a key component of the program's interface, designed to simplify access to essential functions, enhancing your overall user experience and productivity.
