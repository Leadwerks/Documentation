# 3D Spatialization

This tutorial series will help you develop your 3D spatial visualization abilities, and teach you what tools are available to help you make games. Developing these skills will give you the ability to easily visualize how all games can be made.

We will cover some mathematics in the series, but not very much. It's more important to understand what the math does, rather than memorizing equations or solving problems by hand.
