# Face Panel

The Face Panel provides properties and controls for the selected brush faces within your scene. The panel will be visible when you activate the Face tool in the left side bar.

## Texture Mapping

Within the Face Panel, you'll find several parameters that are crucial for manipulating the texture mapping of the selected brush faces:

- Offset: The offset parameter allows you to control the position of the texture mapping on the selected face. Adjusting this parameter shifts the texture relative to the face, enabling precise texture placement.

- Scale: The scale parameter governs the scale of the texture mapping on the selected face. This scale factor works in conjunction with the brush mapping scale set in the program settings within the Options Window. The brush scale factor, specified in texels per meter, is multiplied by the scale factor presented in the Face Panel interface. This combination permits fine-grained control over the size and tiling of textures on the brush faces.

## Texture Alignment

The Face Panel also provides alignment options that simplify the task of aligning textures to the geometry of the brush:

- Alignment Buttons: These buttons offer various alignment options for your textures, allowing you to align them to specific edges, center them on the face, or fit them snugly to the brush face's boundaries. This level of control ensures that your textures blend seamlessly with the brush geometry, enhancing the overall visual appeal of your map.

- Unify Faces: By checking the "Unify Faces" checkbox, you can instruct the texture alignment process to treat all coplanar faces as a single surface. This simplifies the alignment of textures across multiple connected faces, creating a more cohesive and uniform appearance.

The Face Panel empowers you to manage and fine-tune texture mapping on your brush faces, enhancing the visual quality of your map and streamlining the texturing process.
