# Asset Editor

The Asset Editor is a dedicated workspace for interacting with and editing various assets within Ultra Engine. Here's an overview of how it works:

## Opening Assets

To access the Asset Editor, simply double-click the desired asset in the [Asset Browser](assetbrowser.md). This action will open the asset in a new tab within the Asset Editor window.

## Asset-Specific Views

The appearance and available features within the Asset Editor window may vary based on the type of asset you've opened:

### Model Assets

When a model asset is opened, two tabs appear in the Asset Editor window. If the model includes animations, you'll find an animation bar at the bottom of the window, complete with controls for selecting and playing animations.

In the Model Editor, you can also work with any embedded materials and textures packed into the model file, allowing you to select and modify these resources conveniently.

### Material Assets

For material assets, the Asset Editor's properties tab provides access to all material settings and associated textures, enabling you to fine-tune the appearance and behavior of materials.

### Texture Assets

When you open a texture asset in the Asset Editor, you'll find an interface that displays all relevant texture settings. This allows you to edit and customize the properties of the texture.
