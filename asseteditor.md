# Asset Editor

The asset editor is in a separate window. You can open any asset by double-clicking it in the [asset browser](assetbrowser.md). The item will appear in a new tab in the asset editor window.

The appearance of this window will change slightly based on the type of asset that is opened in it. When a model is opened, two tabs appear. If the model is animated, an animation bar will be visible at the bottom of the window, with controls for selecting and playing animations.

Any embedded materials and textures packed into the model file can be selected and modified in this interface.

When a material is opened in the asset editor, the properties tab will contain all material settings and textures.

When a texture is opened in the asset editor, all texture settings are displayed.
