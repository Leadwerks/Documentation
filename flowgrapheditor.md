The flowgraph editor provides an interface for visual editor of scene events. This tool is accessed by pressing the **Flowgraph Editor** button in the left-side bar.

## Adding Objects to the Flowgraph

You can click and drag any object from the [scene tree](mapbrowser.md) into the flowgraph window to make it accessible in the flowgraph interface.

The purpose of the flowgraph editor is to connect inputs and outputs between [components](entitycomponentsystem.md), so you really only want to add entities to the flowgraph editor if they have components you want to connect.
