# Programming with C++

The C++ programming language can be used to write games and simulations with Ultra Engine. C++ provides a low-level close-to-the-metal programming experience with excellent debugging and compatibility with a world of third-party libraries and APIs. Ultra Engine's integration of C++ smart pointers makes programming with C++ about as easy as any memory-managed language, without sacrificing performance.

To get started with C++ in Ultra Engine on Windows, install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/#vs-section). When running the installer, make sure the *Desktop development with C++* option is selected.

To start programming, just open the .sln file found in your C++ Ultra Engine project. Press F5 to compile and run your game.

You can also run any of the [examples](https://www.ultraengine.com/learn/LoadModel?lang=cpp) in this documentation by copying and pasting the code into your main.cpp file. Compile and run the project and the example will be shown.
