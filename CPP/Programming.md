# Programming with C++

C++ is a powerful programming language capable of crafting games and simulations in Ultra Engine. It offers a low-level, close-to-the-metal programming experience while maintaining excellent debugging capabilities and seamless compatibility with a vast array of third-party libraries and APIs. Ultra Engine's integration of C++ smart pointers simplifies C++ development, providing memory management akin to high-level languages without compromising performance.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive into C++ programming for Ultra Engine on Windows, ensure you have the necessary tools in place:

1. **Install Visual Studio Community Edition:**
   - Download and install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/#vs-section).

2. **Select "Desktop Development with C++":**
   - During the installation process, make sure to select the "Desktop development with C++" option.

## Getting Started

To start your C++ programming journey with Ultra Engine, follow these steps:

1. **Open Your C++ Ultra Engine Project:**
   - Locate the .sln file in your C++ Ultra Engine project directory.
   - Open this solution file using Visual Studio Community Edition.

## Environment Variable

On Windows, Leadwerks uses an environment variable to specify the location of header and library files. This will be created automatically by the standalone installer, or you may asked for permission to add it during project creation. You must click OK when prompted, and allow admin access to make the required changes. If you do not do this, the compiler will not be able to locate required files.

You can also add an environment variable manually called "LEADWERKS" and set its value to your install location. To access Windows environment variables, run the **System Properties** app.

Press the **Enviurnment Variables** button. If it does not already exist, you can add a system variable. For the Steam version of Leadwerks, the default path is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Leadwerks". For the standalone version, the default path is "C:\Program Files\Leadwerks". These paths may be different if you installed Steam or Leadwerks to different directories.

Use of an environment variable makes it easier for developers to share C++ projects across different computers.

## Exploring Examples
