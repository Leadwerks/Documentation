Welcome to the **Ultra App Kit** documentation. You're about to learn how to easily create desktop GUI applications.

## Getting Started ##

When you first run Ultra App Kit you will be prompted to sign into your Ultra Engine account:

If you do not have an account you can create one [here](https://www.leadwerks.com/community/register/).

Once you have signed in, the program interface will appear like this:

The program is separated into three main panels that can be shown by selecting the tabs at the top of the window.

The **Projects** panel contains a list of recent projects and allows you to create new projects or add existing ones.

The **Learn** panel contains links to documentation and other online resources including video tutorials and the technical assistance forum.

The **Community** panel contains links to community features, including forums, blogs, and the Ultra Engine Marketplace.

## Creating a Project ##

To start programming with C++ you need to install the free [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) from Microsoft.

To create a new project click the **Create** link in the **Projects** panel. Enter the project name and location, then click the **Create** button to generate the new project:

The project folder will be opened automatically. Double-click the .sln file to open the Visual Studio solution:

Once Visual Studio is opened, you can compile and run the project by selecting the **Debug > Start Debugging** menu item:

## Learning Resources ##
- The documentation here describes all available classes and functions in the SDK. You can copy any code samples in the documentation into the *main.cpp* file to run that sample. Try running the code example [here](CreateButton.md) in your project.
- Officlal video tutorials are available [here](https://www.leadwerks.com/community/video/browse/3-tutorials).
- You can ask questions and get answers from staff and other developers in the [technical assistance forum](https://www.leadwerks.com/community/forum/91-technical-assistance).
