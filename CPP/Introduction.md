Welcome to the **Ultra App Kit** documentation. You're about to learn how to easily create desktop GUI applications.

When you run Ultra App Kit the program interface will look like this:

The program is separated into three main panels that can be shown by selecting the tabs at the top of the window.

The **Projects** panel contains a list of recent projects and allows you to create new projects or add existing ones.

The **Learn** panel contains links to documentation and other online resources including video tutorials and the technical assistance forum.

The **Community** panel contains links to community features, including forums, blogs, and the Ultra Engine Marketplace.

To create a new project click the **Create** link under the **Projects** tab. Enter the project name and location, then click the **Create** button to generate the new project:
