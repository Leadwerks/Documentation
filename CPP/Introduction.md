# Welcome

Welcome to the Ultra App Kit documentation. You're about to learn how to easily create fast and responsive desktop GUI applications with pixel-perfect DPI scaling.

## Getting Started

When you first run Ultra App Kit you will be prompted to sign into your Ultra Engine account. This only needs to be done once for each new computer you install the program on. If you do not have an account you can create one [here](https://www.ultraengine.com/community/register/).

Once you have signed in, the program interface will appear like this:

The program is separated into three main panels that can be shown by selecting the tabs at the top of the window.

The **Projects** panel contains a list of recent projects and allows you to create new projects or add existing ones.

The **Learn** panel contains links to documentation and other online resources including video tutorials and the technical assistance forum.

The **Community** panel contains links to community features, including forums, blogs, and the Ultra Engine Marketplace.
