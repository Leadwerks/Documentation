# Welcome to Leadwerks 5
Welcome to the **Leadwerks 5 SDK** documentation. You're about to learn how to use the fastest 3D engine in the world to create high-performance simulations and games.

Leadwerks 5 SDK supports three programming languages. C++ offers the fastest code execution speed, best compatibility with third-party libraries, and is suitable for advanced projects. C# offers fast compilation times, easier syntax, and is fast enough for most projects. Lua is lightweight, easy to learn, and is suitable for simple projects. Additionally, Lua scripts can be combined with programs written in C++ and C#.
