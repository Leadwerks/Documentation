# Create a Project

To start programming with C++ you need to install the free [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) from Microsoft.

To create a new project click the **Create** link in the **Projects** panel. Enter the project name and location, then click the **Create** button to generate the new project:

The project folder will be opened automatically. Double-click the .sln file to open the Visual Studio solution:

Once Visual Studio is opened, you can compile and run the project by selecting the **Debug > Start Debugging** menu item:

This documentation system describes all available classes and functions in the SDK. You can copy any code samples in the documentation into the *main.cpp* file to run that sample. Try running the code example [here](CreateButton.md) in your project.

For further assistance, you can ask questions and get answers from staff and other developers in the [technical assistance forum](https://www.leadwerks.com/community/forum/91-technical-assistance).
