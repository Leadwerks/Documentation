# Networking

Ultra Engine includes a simple networking system that allows communication between different computers, to create multiplayer games.

For computers that are connected behind a router, a relay server must be created. Alternatively, you can use the [Steamworks](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworking) P2P networking system.
