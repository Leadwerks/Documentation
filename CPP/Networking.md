Ultra Engine includes a simple networking system that allows communication between different computers. This is useful for basic testing and  communication between two applications running on the same machine.

For computers that are connected behind a router, a relay server must be created, or you can use the [Steamworks](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworking) peer-to-peer networking system.
