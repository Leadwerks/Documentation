# Camera::SetRefractionMode

This method controls the camera refraction effect.

## Syntax 

- void **SetRefractionMode**(const bool mode)

## Remarks

In order for the transparency refraction effect to be visible, the camera refraction mode must be set to true and a material with transparency enabled, a normal map, and a refraction index less than one must be visible in the scene.
