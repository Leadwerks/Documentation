# Floor

This function rounds a decimal number down to the lower integer and returns the result.

## Syntax

- **Floor**(f: float): number
- **Floor**(f: number): number

## Returns

Returns the lower integer value.

## Example

```lua
-- Assumes UltraEngine library is already imported

local f = 1.6
Print(Ceil(f))
Print(Floor(f))
```
Note: In Lua, there is no need to include libraries like in C++. We assume that the required libraries are already imported.
