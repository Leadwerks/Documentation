# Scripting

Ultra Engine supports scripts written with the [Lua](https://www.lua.org) programming language.
Scripts can be attached to entities or used to control the entire program.

Ultra Engine uses Lua 5.4 to give you access to [the very latest Lua features](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/readme.html#changes).
