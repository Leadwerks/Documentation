Lua is a fun and easy scripting language widely employed in a variety of games, ranging from popular titles like Angry Birds to Call of Duty. Its simplicity and flexibility make it an excellent choice for both novice developers and experienced programmers looking to swiftly bring their ideas to life.

## Script Editor

The [script editor](scripteditor.md) will open any time you double-click on a code file in the [project panel](assetbrowser.md), or you can select the **Scripting > Script Editor** item in the main menu.

The [programming reference](https://www.leadwerks.com/learn/LoadModel?lang=lua) includes examples for most commands. To run an example, just copy the code from the example section of the page, and paste it into the file Scripts/Main.lua, overwriting its contents.
