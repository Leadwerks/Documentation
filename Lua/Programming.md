# Programming with Lua

Lua is a fun and easy scripting language used in hundreds of games, from Angry Birds to Call of Duty. The language's simplicity and flexibility makes it a great choice for beginning developers or seasoned coders who want to rapidly prototype their ideas.

To get started programming Ultra Engine with Lua, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

You can open an Ultra Engine Lua project in VSCode by double-clicking on the batch file named "Open in VSCode.bat".

If you don't have it installed already, you will be prompted to download the [Lua debugger addon](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=devCAT.lua-debug). This will allow you to debug Ultra Engine games written with Lua.

To support Lua debugging, you must also enable the "Allow Breakpoints Everywhere" option in the User > Features > Debug settings.

You can press F5 to run the game, or copy [an example](https://www.ultraengine.com/learn/LoadModel?lang=lua) from the documentation into main.lua to see it in action.
