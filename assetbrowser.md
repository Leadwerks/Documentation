# Asset Browser

The asset browser is divided in half, with the top half containing a search bar and displaying the directory structure of your project. The bottom panel displays thumbnails for all the files in the selected directory.

You can double click a file icon to open it. If it is a file that Ultra Engine supports, it will be opened in an [asset editor](asseteditor.md) window. Otherwise, the file will load with your system's default program for that file type.

When you hover the mouse over a file thumbnail, a popup preview will appear displaying a larger view of the file, along with the file name and some extra information.

You can prevent specific file extensions from appearing in the asset browser with the *File type blacklist* setting in the [options window](optionswindow.md).
