# Asset Browser

The Asset Browser is a versatile tool designed to simplify your project management tasks. It offers a user-friendly interface, which is split into two main sections for efficient navigation and file exploration.

Here's a breakdown of its key features:

### Directory Structure
The top half of the Asset Browser displays a search bar and the directory structure of your project. This section allows you to easily locate and organize your project's files and assets. You can navigate through your project's folders and directories, making it convenient to access and manage your resources.

### File Thumbnails
The bottom panel of the Asset Browser showcases thumbnail representations of all the files within the selected directory. These thumbnails provide a visual overview of your project's assets, making it easier to identify and select the files you need.

The Asset Browser also offers a useful feature to filter and customize your view. You can define specific file extensions to be excluded from the browser using the "File Type Blacklist" setting. This setting can be configured within the Options Window, allowing you to tailor your Asset Browser experience to your project's requirements.

### Opening Files
To open a file, simply double-click its icon. If the file format is supported by Ultra Engine, it will be launched in an [asset editor](asseteditor.md) window, providing you with an environment for editing and enhancing the asset. In cases where the file format is not directly supported, it will be opened using your system's default program associated with that specific file type.

### File Previews
Hovering your mouse pointer over a file thumbnail triggers a convenient popup preview. This preview displays a larger view of the file, along with its name and additional relevant information. This feature aids in quickly identifying files without the need to open them, enhancing your workflow efficiency.

With its intuitive interface and powerful features, the Asset Browser is an indispensable tool for managing your project's assets and streamlining your workflow.
