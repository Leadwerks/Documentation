# Ray Casting #
Leadwerks 5 includes routines for performing ray intersection tests. You can call [World::Pick](API_World_Pick_FP.md) to
perform a ray cast on all entities in a world. You can perform per-entity ray casts with [Entity::Pick](API_Entity_Pick_FP.md).
You can also perform a ray cast on a single collider using the [Collider::Pick](API_Collider_Pick_FP.md) method.
