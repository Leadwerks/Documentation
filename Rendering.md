# Rendering #
To initialize graphics, the hardware displays must first be queried with [ListDisplays](API_ListDisplays.md).
A [Window](API_Window.md) is then created on one of the displays and a [Framebuffer](API_Framebuffer.md) is created on the window.
You can also render to a texture using a [TextureBuffer](API_TextureBuffer.md) object.
