# Console

The Console is a valuable tool for monitoring the program's log, warnings, and error messages. It provides insight into the operation of Ultra Engine and helps you identify and troubleshoot issues as they arise.

## Executing Lua Commands

You can also utilize the Console to execute Lua commands directly within the editor. To do so, follow these steps:

1. In the entry field at the bottom of the Console, enter your Lua command.

   For example, you can copy and paste the following line of Lua code into the entry field:

   ```lua
   Notify("Hello, world!")
   ```
   
2. Press the "Enter" key to execute the command.

This feature allows you to quickly test and run Lua scripts within the editor environment, making it a powerful tool for scripting and testing functionalities.

Inspecting Variable Values
If you need to examine the value of a variable within the Lua virtual machine, you can achieve this easily in the Console:

1. Type the variable name into the entry field by itself.

2. Press the "Enter" key.

The Console will display the current value of the specified variable, aiding in the debugging and understanding of your Lua scripts.
