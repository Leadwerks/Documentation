The terrain panel contains controls for editing terrain and terrain material layers. The sculpt tool can be used to raise and lower the terrain. The paint tool can be used to paint the currently selected material layer onto the terrain. There are sliders to control the tool radius and strength.

The material layer list provides a display of all material layers the terrain uses. Each material layer can have its texture mapping scale adjusted in the control below. Each material layer can have optional height and slope contraints set to control what parts of the terrain the material layer can be painted onto.
